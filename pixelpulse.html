            <p>Designed to meet the lack of helpful resources available to UoL Computer Science, PixelPulse aims to serve as both inspiration (project based modules) and revision (theory based modules). Users can create an account, log in, and post their p5js sketches. Users can also like and comment on others’ posts. After extensive research ASP Team 54 found a lack of interactive educational resources and after multiple user tests we assured our assumptions that this is a product students would benefit from!</p>

            <h2 class="main-heading">Role and responsibility</h2>
            <p>As part of a team of 4, I was responsible for:<br><br>
                1. Market Research: I conducted extensive market research to understand the needs and preferences of the target audience. This research included checking indirect competitors such as social media platforms like Instagram and coding sites such as Leetcode to identify trends and user expectations. Additionally, I explored existing applications and software available from the university to ensure our project offered a unique value to users.<br><br>
                2. Resource Gathering: This involved collating all required documents and resources needed to build the project. As part of the the submission I spoke to previous students and relayed their approach to my team ensuring we were set up for success from the beginning.<br><br>
                3. Document Coordination: As the document coordinator, I organized and maintained all project-related documentation, ensuring that files, reports, and project plans were consistently up to date and readily accessible for the team.<br><br>
                4. High Fidelity Prototype: I developed the high-fidelity interactive prototype, allowing us to present a visual representation of the app's functionality and design to our stakeholders. This played a pivotal role in receiving feedback for iterative and user centered design.

                5. Styling and UI: I was responsible for the styling and user interface (UI) design of the final project. This included creating a visually appealing and user-friendly interface that aligned with our market research and stakeholder expectations, achieving a SUS score of 82.5.<br><br>
                6. Project Management: I took on project management responsibilities by setting project milestones in Trello, tracking progress, and ensuring that our team adhered to the established timelines. This helped us maintain focus and meet our deadlines effectively.</p>

            <h2 class="main-heading">The design</h2>
            <p>The aesthetic was made as minimal as possible, mimicking that of popular social media platforms. This was done for familiarity; we found that users were used to a specific layout and style and if we differed from that too much it wouldn’t have the social media feel.</p>

            <p>All decisions were made with feedback from our stakeholders. As a team we conducted multiple user surveys and tests to which I iterated on. No decision was made without taking into consideration our extensive research and our user responses.</p>
                
            <p>Accessibility was a very important feature that I pushed to add. The accessibility menu is something I’ve iterated on over the course of developing multiple websites. It offers much more customizability to try and help users as much as possible. Aside from building an accessible website using ARIA and best practices, it was important to me that users had some level of customization to better tweak the website to their needs. Using localStorage I was able to keep the users’ preferences for the next time they navigated to PixelPulse.</p>
