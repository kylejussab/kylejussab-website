    <main class="content-container">
        <div class="content">
            <p class="blog-paragraph">I’m not ashamed to admit that I’ve had my low points mentally, and that I’ve done some questionable things to try and help myself that have both failed and succeeded, but when prompted with the question of how I deal with it / have dealt with it I almost always say “play a video game”, and I genuinely mean it, but is there something behind it? Can video games actually help with your mental health?</p>
            <p class="blog-paragraph">The majority of the inspiration for this blog was from a paper by Rebecca Lin at the University of Maryland, in which she goes over the potential video games have in treating depression and anxiety. The idea behind Rebecca’s paper was to primarily engage American counsellors to do further research into gaming’s counselling potential and hopefully make mental health treatment more accessible to those who cannot reach face-to-face counselling. Rebecca states that in 2019, 55% of American adults with treatable disorders failed to receive treatment, and a 2022 report about the “essential facts about video games” stated that 66% of Americans play video games regularly with the average age of video game players being 33. It’s undeniable video games have a wide reach, the revenue is projected to reach US$208.6bn in 2022, with the number of gamers worldwide expected to cross 3 billion this year as well. Rebecca goes into more detail about speciality games like SPARX, the benefits and drawbacks of gamification, and even the sceptic view of escapism rather than dealing with problems head on. Though I will primarily focus on recreational games and how they might help with lower levels of depression or anxiety, Rebecca’s paper goes into more detail on the idea of using specialised video games as a supplement to traditional counselling and provides very strong evidence to back her claim. If that has peaked your interest in any way I would recommend that you read her paper as well.</p>
            <p class="blog-paragraph">Animal Crossing: New Horizons seemingly came to be right when the world needed it most. Releasing in 2020 during the Coronavirus pandemic lockdowns, the world of Animal Crossing allowed players to regain their sense of routine in a friendly and safe environment. Encouraging players to partake in daily activities such as collecting fruit, planting flowers or even interior/exterior design. This calming environment on a tropical island provided many players with relaxation from a stressful situation, but don’t let me try to convince you of its success. In 2020, ACNH won “Best Family Game” at the Game Awards, “Game of the Year” at the Japan Game awards, “Nintendo Game of the Year” at the Gold Joystick awards, and in 2021 won the “Game Beyond Entertainment” at the British Academy Game awards. It is the second highest selling game on Nintendo Switch with a whopping 39.38 million copies sold as of June 30th 2022 beating some of the most famous Nintendo games like Zelda and Pokémon. Now… correlation does not imply causation, but I speak purely from my own experience in just how well video games can alleviate stressful or even depressing thoughts.</p>
            <p class="blog-paragraph">For me at least, playing video games gave me a sense of purpose, it gave me a goal and rewarded me when I achieved it. The Journal of the American Medical Association Psychiatry published a study in 2021 about how improvements in learning processes also led to improvements in depression symptoms. I tie this finding with the process of improving your skills to overcome that really hard boss in a video game. The act of learning a new skill, improving on it and succeeding boosted my self-esteem and confidence. Sure, in the grand scope of things the skills that I learnt in the game didn’t translate to productive skills in real life, but it was something. I was down and out, mentally and physically, and I mean really low, but just that little bit of confidence went a long way. I dealt with my depression by learning a lot of new skills in the real world, like skateboarding or solving a Rubik’s cube, and I never would’ve done that if I didn’t get that initial burst of confidence from finishing a game. I think that because the effort required to play a video game is not as much as that of self-improvement, it’s an amazing way to get the ball rolling and put you on the path of getting better.</p>
            <p class="blog-paragraph">“Video games provide connection, a critical aspect of mental health; feeling like you are part of a community of like-minded people who value your participation and share your goal within the game.” (Glenn Platt, PhD, a professor of emerging technology). Going back to games like Animal Crossing New Horizons, the multiplayer aspect of games allows gamers to feel connected and may even reduce feelings of loneliness. “Isolation plays a significant role in depressive disorders, the support of a community within a game ecosystem mitigates this”. This could be working as a team towards a specific goal, but I just think the interactivity between two players who genuinely like the game they are playing can be enough in some cases. Rebecca touched on this in her paper, sometimes it’s easier to open up and speak when your spirits are lifted, or when you share some attachment to the game. If you are a gamer, it is highly likely you’ve made new friends just through video games alone, and though I definitely advocate seeking quote-unquote real help, I honestly believe video games can help. They might not fix or solve all your problems but they do have benefits.</p>
            <p class="blog-paragraph">So next time you are feeling a little down you might want to consider planting a flower on a tropical island getaway, exploring a vastly big fantasy world, or even scoring a goal in a vehicular football game. Next time you’re feeling a little down maybe… maybe it’s worth playing a video game.</p>
