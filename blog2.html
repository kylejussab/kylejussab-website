    <main class="content-container">
        <div class="content">
            <p class="blog-paragraph">I’ve felt out of place, especially in a university with many different talented and intelligent students. I’ve been overwhelmed by just how good other students are, and that maybe I shouldn’t be here, or even be in the same conversation as these students. They’re clearly better at this than I am, and what happens further down the line when everyone realizes that I’m not as good, or even worse… I’m not supposed to be here at all.</p>
            <p class="blog-paragraph">I quickly realized I was suffering from imposter syndrome, which is feeling inadequate despite your accomplishments and hard work. I would put all my effort into a submission only to read someone else’s and find that theirs was far better than mine. Despite all my hard work, the 100% commitment I gave, and the good grade I received for it, I still felt like I was not only fooling everyone else, but fooling myself into believing that I should be a part of this cohort. This feeling only grew and led me to believing that at some point everyone would know I wasn’t good enough, so why should I bother trying anyway right?</p>
            <p class="blog-paragraph">Though I’m no expert, I have managed to overcome that initial hurdle, and if you happen to be in a similar boat as I was, I have a few pointers on how I dealt with imposter syndrome, and hopefully they too help you battle this unforgiving enemy.</p>
            <h4>1. You’re not alone</h4>
            <p class="blog-paragraph">The very first thing I did was speak to a few of my friends, and a few of the students to tell them how I was feeling. Surprisingly, or should I say unsurprisingly, I found out that they too felt imposter syndrome at some point! I found reassurance in knowing that I was not alone in this battle. Some of the students in my degree are some of the most talented people I’ve ever spoken to, and I would look up to them, and aspire to produce quality work like theirs. These immensely talented students also felt inadequate with their work, but from my perspective their work was phenomenal. Could it be that it’s just my perspective of my own work causing me to feel inadequate? Most likely yes!</p>
            <h4>2. You actually are good enough</h4>
            <p class="blog-paragraph">The perfectionist in you might speak with a louder tone when amplifying what you’re doing wrong, but that is a small fraction of the larger picture of just how much you’re doing right. If you’re committed and trying as hard as you can then you’re already on the right track! You wouldn’t have been accepted by the university if you weren’t good enough, you wouldn’t have come this far if you weren’t good enough. In some form you’ve made progress, whether that is substantial or not, progress is still progress. Don’t let that voice speak about how far you have left to travel, think about just how far you’ve already come!</p>
            <h4>3. You are your only competition</h4>
            <p class="blog-paragraph">This should go without saying, but I feel it is important to mention when talking about imposter syndrome. In my case a lot of what drove my feelings of inadequacy was seeing just how good, or how much work other students have done and comparing myself to them. We’re all different, in fact I think we’re more different than we are similar. Comparing yourself to anyone is unfair on you because it locks you into a mindset of what success looks like. You can be successful your own way. We all have different paths, but all paths lead to the same destination. Focus on being better than the person you were yesterday, or focus on the next step you have to take.</p>
            <h4>4. You can make the most out of anything</h4>
            <p class="blog-paragraph">My final point is that imposter syndrome isn’t going anywhere. Though I have overcome that one instance of it, I’m sure it’s not the only time I’ll have to deal with it, but that’s okay. Not only was I able to overcome it, I feel I came out of it a stronger more driven individual because of it. It pushed me in ways that encouraged me to tackle my weaknesses and succeed in doing so. Let it come, embrace it actually. This feeds back to my point on perspective; why should imposter syndrome be a bad thing? Use it as a motivational tool, use as a self-reflective tool. You can be better, and you will be better. Talk back to that voice inside your head and tell it you’re stronger, and you’ll prove that it&#39;s wrong. You do belong because you have a talent, you have a goal, and quite frankly nothing, not even imposter syndrome… will stop that from happening.</p>
